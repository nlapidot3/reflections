###When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating on a project with oters and when using different computers in working on the files in the repository.

###Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may not be ready to make your commits public.

###Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are essentially clones of other people's repositories and are used when you don't have permission to change the other person's repository directly. Clones copy the contents of a
repository and can be used both locally in copying a repo from one location to another on your computer and remotely in copying a repo from GitHub. Branches are continuations of a repo
that already exists and are not for copying purposes.
