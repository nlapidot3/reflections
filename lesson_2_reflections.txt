###What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden .git directory is created in the directory in which you initialized the repository. The benefit
of using it is that it starts storing meta data about the repository, including information about the
commit history and the changes made.

###How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you
###think it offers?
Staging area is an in-between environment that isn't permanently stored. It is where files that have been
added from the working directory reside until you commit them to the repository. The advantage in this is
that it allows you to specify which files you want to add to a single commit instead of forcing you to
commit everything at once.

###How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use the "git diff --staged" command to compare the changes in the staging area to the most recent
commit in the repository. This will list all of the differences, allowing you to track whether more than
one logical change has been put in the staging area.
