###How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It pinpoints the particular lines that differed between the two versions. Although it didn't give
specific indications of the differences, it narrowed down the search to sections of manageable
length for the manual review.

###How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient 
###programmer in the long term?
It allows you to trace the progression and transformation of your script, thereby allowing you to
see how your thought evolved over time to deal with different issues. This allows you to learn
from your mistakes and build on previous lessons learned when rereading the change history. In
addition, when you work through an issue, you may recall a time when you have already done so,
and in those situations, being able to pull up the file with all of the historical changes you
have made to a file, allows you to find that occurrence and repeat the implemented solution
and perhaps even improve upon it.

###What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like
###you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: You are in control and get to choose commit points that are more meaningful to you.
Cons: This relies on you remembering when to commit, which you can easily forget to do.

###Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in 
###one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git appears to have more of a project-oriented approach, while Google Docs (and other similar
version control systems) take more of a file-specific approach.

###How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows you the log of all of the commits and allows you to identify the ones you want to
inspect for individual changes. git diff then can be used to compare two commits to see the
differences between them and identify the changes made from one version to the other.

###How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break
###something?
It allows you to relatively easily identify the previous version that was immediately before the
version in which the error was introduced, thereby allowing you to more easily pinpoint where
the error was made.

###Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I'll try using it for homework for my Machine Learning for Trading course and perhaps other
courses as well. I'll also try to start using it for my side projects (e.g. beer rating
predictor).
